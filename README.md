# Cache-Design-Simulator
Designed and implemented a configurable L1 and L2 cache simulator in C++. The simulator models a realistic multi-level cache hierarchy with support for configurable cache size, associativity, and block size, using an LRU replacement policy and write-back, write-allocate (WBWA) write strategy.
